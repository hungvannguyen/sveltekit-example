								review="Been recommending Mosh for years... probably a decade by now. I've lost count of how many developers and business people I have shared one of his videos with. Not much to say other than he's one of the best instructors out there. Great personality for teaching and a solid mastery of the subject matter. He's always going to be my first stop for learning something new."

									"I'm a self taught software engineer. During this period of study I completed many courses, trying to emulate a computer science education. Mosh's courses helped me all the way and the ones I continue coming back to and referencing as a professional software engineer.",
									"I already held a degree and didn't want to incure the cost of going to college again. I'm also pretty motivated, so Mosh's structured courses worked well for me.",
									'May courses will teach you a framework or technology, but these are highly perishable skills. Mosh will teach you to think like a software engineer and load you with the correct fundamentals that will give you confidence when you get in the workplace.',
									'Thanks for everything Mosh!'

I can't thank him enough for the incredible impact his courses and exceptional teaching methods have had on my journey in programming."

I've been learning from him for over four years, and the growth in my professional career has been remarkable. It's totally worth it. I am incredibly thankful to have found him."

									'Mosh comes up with the best, well-structured and informative courses as always. I have seen most of his YouTube videos in his channel and he is the main reason I fell in love with programming. Mosh not only teaches you the concepts, but also points out what it takes to be a professional developer that makes one stand out. I highly recommend his courses to all.',
